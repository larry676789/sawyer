/**
 * JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
 * This format is used to interchange data between web applications and is the defacto standard for most APIs
 * JSON objects take the form {key:value}, the values can be any valid JavaScript identifier
 * E.G.
 * const sawyer = {firstname: 'Kevin', lastname: 'Shelton', age: 30}
 * You access the properties using dot notation
 * sawyer.firstname // returns 'Kevin'
 * In this assignment you must write a function that takes in first name, last name and age and returns a JSON object.
