## Working With Transform Streams & Grabbing Video Frames
Videos are a series of still images coupled with audio frames. In this exercise you will take a video and display the video frames. This is accomplished with [Track Processors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrackProcessor) and [Transform Streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream).
